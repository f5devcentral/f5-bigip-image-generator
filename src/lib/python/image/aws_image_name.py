    Contains naming rules and transformations for AWS images

    Official naming rules from EC2 console:
    AMI names must be between 3 and 128 characters long, and may contain letters, numbers, '(',
    ')', '.', '-', '/' and '_'

    Note that we use a tighter restriction on the maximum length than what's officially allowed.
    This is done to provide parity with the other clouds and allow room for additional suffixes
    on top of names which are already close to the current limit.
