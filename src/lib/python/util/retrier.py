# pylint would prefer that this entire class be turned into a function which tracks its state
# internally.  This would be possible if adding the optional 'tries' and 'delay' variables to the
# calling signature didn't cause ambiguity with the *args and **kwargs passed to the retried method.
# Instead, we use this class as a container for optionally injecting the 'tries' and 'delay'
# variables as state which is external to the signature.  For example:
# retrier = Retrier(some_function, value1, arg2=value2) # unambiguous calling signature
# retrier.tries = 5                                     # state declared optionally
# retrier.execute()                                     # state gets injected into signature here
# pylint: disable=too-few-public-methods
