## AWS

In AWS, the image generator tool will do the following:

1. Create a virtual disk image locally.
2. Upload the virtual disk image to an [S3 Bucket storage][1] container.
3. Create the virtual machine image.


### Prerequisites

You need the system requirements described [here](../../../README.md), as well as sufficient permissions for a [VM Import Service Role][2] to create or describe the following resources: 

* Credentials/API keys 
* SSH keys uploaded 
* [S3 Bucket][1] 
* IAM Role with import permissions (see this [AWS article][2] for more information)
* Install the [ovftool][22] for creating the virtual disk.

### User guide

Define the following parameters in a config file or set as an environment variable.  Optionally, you can use these parameters at the command line with leading dashes (for example, `--aws-region`).

|Parameter|Required|Values|Description|
|:--------|:-------|:-----|:----------|
|AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID|Yes|[value]|Public key id string used for AWS account access.|
|AWS_BUCKET|Yes|[value]|AWS S3 bucket used during image generation.|
|AWS_IMAGE_SHARE_ACCOUNT_IDS|No|[value]|List of AWS account IDs with which you want the generated image shared.|
|AWS_REGION|Yes|[value]|Region to use for AWS image generation.|
|AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY|Yes|[value]|Public key string used for AWS account access.|

##### NOTE:
------------
F5 recommends passing the credentials via ENV or CLI, rather than putting them in a configuration file.

------------------

#### Example:

The following example generates an  LTM_1SLOT image for a BIG-IP VE 15.X. For deployed image sizes for various BIG-IP VE versions, see the [K14946][4] article.

```
./build-image -i /var/tmp/BIGIP-15.0.0-0.0.39.iso -c config.yml -p aws -m ltm -b 1

```
