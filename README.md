## Introduction

The F5 Virtual Edition (VE) team developed the F5 BIG-IP Image Generator internally to do the following:

* Create custom images from the .ISO file for both F5 BIG-IP hardware and VE releases or for hot-fixes that are not available on the various public cloud marketplaces.
* Provide pre-deployment file customization of BIG-IP (for example, SSH keys, trusted certificates, custom packages, and so forth).
* Automatically publish images to public cloud providers.
* Simplify deployment workflows, such as encrypting custom images in AWS (prevents launching an instance in the marketplace first).

##### SECURITY WARNING
----------------------
It is your responsibility to:

1.	Secure and restrict access to the environment on which you run the VE Image Generator tool, and in your cloud environment. 
2.	Remove any sensitive data on the created image PRIOR to automatically publishing the image to the cloud.

------------------------------

## Prerequisites
This section provides prerequisites for running the F5 Image Generator, creating virtual images, and for supported cloud providers.

#### Image Generator prerequisites
The following table lists system requirements for using the Image Generator to create  virtualized images of the following supported BIG-IP ISO packages:

| Component                 | Version                                                         | Recommended System Requirements|                                                      
|---------------------------| :---------------------------------------------------------------| :------------------------------|
| F5 BIG-IP Image Generator | 1.0                                                             | - **Memory**: 1GB memory <br> - **Disk space**: depends on number of images you want to create.<br> See following BIG-IP VE system requirements.|                                                             
| [F5 BIG-IP VE][1]         | BIG-IP 13.1.0.2+ Support<br>BIG-IP 14.X<br>BIG-IP 15.X          | A minimum of 20GB per image    |    
| Ubuntu (F5 Image Generator-validated)                    | 18.04 LTS operating system       | Tools: <br>- Git<br> - Python 3.x<br> - Cloud provider SDK tools <br> See [setup script][2].|

                                                                                                 
##### Environment recommendations
Due to several required tools/SDKs to generate images, F5 Networks recommends using a standalone machine/environment for the BIG-IP Image Generator. F5 provides a [setup script][2] to assist in setting up that environment. The script installs Python packages in a virtual environment to isolate them from the rest of the system; however, the script also installs other tools, such as zip, directly into the base environment. These packages are not downloaded from F5 repositories, but come from the respective project repositories. It is your responsibility to verify that these packages are safe to use. 

#### Supported platforms and prerequisites
The following table lists supported public and private cloud platforms as well as account setup requirements:

| Cloud Provider            | Requirements                                                                                                        
|---------------------------| :---------------------------------------------------------------|
| AWS                       | Sufficient permissions to create or describe the following resources:<br> - credentials/API Keys<br> - [S3 Bucket Storage Container][12]<br> - IAM Role with import permissions <br>(See this [AWS article][3] for more VM Import Service Role information.)|
| Azure                     | Sufficient permissions to create or describe the following resources:<br> - Credentials/API Keys<br> - [Storage Container][11] <br>(See this [Azure article][10] for more information about creating a service principle.)|
| Google Cloud (GCE)        | Sufficient permissions to create or describe the following resources:<br> - Credentials/API Keys<br> - Application  credentials<br> - [Storage Container][13] <br>(See this [GCE article][9] for more service account information.)|

The following supported platforms require no specific configuration:

* **QCOW2** (KVM Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS; OpenStack) - See [VE Setup for KVM][18] for more information.
* **VHD** (Microsoft Hyper-V) - See [VE Setup for Hyper-V][17] for more information.
* **VMware** (ESX/i Server) - See [VE Setup for vSphere][14] for more information. For advanced setup, see [creating ISO using TMOS-cloud-init][15] and [configuring user data][16]. 


##### Virtualization requirements
The Image Generator tool generates a virtual disk image from the BIG-IP product ISO. During the creation, you can specify a cloud provider. Doing so generates a virtual disk image, automatically uploads that disk to that cloud provider, and creates a virtual machine image. Options include:

* **Enabling virtualization** creates a virtual disk in **10-15 minutes** (RECOMMENDED). 
* Disabling virtualization creates a virtual disk in 1-2 hours. 

##### Tip
----------
F5 recommends running the Image Generator tool in environments where virtualization is enabled (for example, **AWS i3.metal** instance). 

Execution times differ between cloud providers, usually taking 5-20 minutes depending on the image size. The BIG-IP Image Generator will display a **warning**, if you run the script in an **insufficient** environment **without virtualization** support.

For more information about virtualization support, see [KVM Virtualization][4].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Setup guide

This section provides steps for installing the generator tool, and then using the setup script. The setup script installs tools/SDKs required to generate images for all supported platforms, and takes several minutes to complete. During this setup process, certain services will require a restart.

1. Do one of the following to install the BIG-IP Image Generator source code from gitlab.

   * Clone
     
     `$ git init`
     `$ git clone git@gitswarm.f5net.com:vteam-cloud/ve-image-generator.git`
     `$ cd ve-image-generator`
     `$ git checkout v1.0` (checkout the tag associated with the release version you want to install)

   * Download
   
     1. Point your browser to [insert github url], open the branch with the tag associated for the release you want to install, click **Download**, and then select the file type (zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2, or tar) you want to install.
     2. At your command line, type the following (this example is uses tar.gz file type):
    
        ```$ scp -i ~/.ssh/my_key Downloads/ve-image-generator-dev.tar.gz ubuntu@image-generator-ip:/home/ubuntu/```
        ```$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_key ubuntu@image-generator-ip```
        ```ubuntu@image-generator-ip:~$ tar -xzvf ve-image-generator-dev.tar.gz```
        ```ubuntu@image-generator-ip:~$ cd ve-image-generator``` 

2. To run the [setup script][2], type:  

   `./setup-build-env`
   
   Options include:
   
   * `--skip-vmware-tools` - disables download of VMware tools and assumes that you have already installed ovftool or do not intend to use it 
   * `--add-dev-tools` - installs additional tools for development, such as pylint, shellcheck, and bats

3. Restart your computer, or log out, and then log back into your system.

## User guide

This section provides steps for creating a [config.yml][5] file that defines frequently used settings and shared variables that the BIG-IP Image Generator will use for creating custom images, running the Image Generator tool, and then customizing log details for monitoring progress. 

1. Create a [config.yml][5] for frequently used settings and shared variables. The BIG-IP Image Generator will only use the variable definitions applicable to the specified provider and ignores other variables.

2. Define the following shared parameters or set as an environment variable. Optionally, use these parameters on the command line with leading dashes (for example, `--platform`). In some cases, you can use a shorthand flag. If a parameter is defined in multiple places, then the priority in descending order is:
command line >  configuration file >  environment variable. To access the Image Generator help file, run `-h/--help`.

    |Parameter|Flag|Required|Values|Description|
    |:--------|:---|:-------|:-----|:----------|
    |BOOT_LOCATIONS|-b|Yes|[1 \| 2]|Number of boot locations used in the source ISO file.|
    |CLEAN| |No| |Delete local files created by previous runs of the same <PLATFORM, MODULES, BOOT_LOCATIONS> combination.|
    |CLOUD_IMAGE_NAME| |No|[value]|The name of the generated cloud image.  The name is subject to cloud provider naming restrictions  and is not guaranteed to succeed.  If you provide no name, then one is generated automatically  based on the detected properties of the source ISO file.|
    |CONFIG_FILE|-c|No|[value]|Full path to a YAML configuration file containing a list of parameter key/value pairs used during image generation.|
    |EHF_ISO|-e|No|[value]|Full path to an engineering hotfix ISO file for installation on top of the existing ISO file.|
    |EHF_ISO_SIG|-x|No|[value]|Full path to an engineering hotfix ISO signature file used to validate the engineering hotfix ISO.|
    |HELP|-h|No| |Print help and usage information, and then exit the program.|
    |IMAGE_DIR| |No|[value]|The directory where you want generated images to reside. Provide either an absolute path or a relative path. If this directory does not exist, the tool will create it.|
    |IMAGE_REGISTRATION_URL| |No|[value]|Instance Registration URL.  Register image details using platform, image id, and image name as keys.|
    |IMAGE_TAGS| |No|[value]|List of key value pairs to set as tags/labels for the image.|
    |ISO|-i|Yes|[value]|Full path to a BIG-IP ISO file used as a basis for image generation.|
    |ISO_SIG|-s|No|[value]|Full path to an ISO signature file used to validate the ISO.|
    |ISO_SIG_PUBKEY| |No|[value]|Path to the F5 public key. Setting this will enable signature verification for ISOs.|
    |LOG_FILE| |No|[value]|Log filename that overrides the default log filename created in the logs directory. You can use a full path, directory, or filename. If full path, then the log file uses the full path. If directory, then the image generator creates a new log file in the specified directory. If filename, then the tool creates a log file in the logs directory using the specified filename.|
    |LOG_LEVEL| |No|[CRITICAL \| ERROR \| WARNING \| INFO \| DEBUG \| TRACE]|Log level to use for the log file, indicating the lowest message severity level that can appear in the log file.|
    |MODULES|-m|Yes|[all \| ltm]|BIG-IP components supported by the specified image.|
    |OVA_SIGN_ENCRYPTION_TYPE| |No|[value]|Encryption type to use when signing OVA files.|
    |OVA_SIGN_PRIVATE_KEY| |No|[value]|Path to private key file used to sign OVA files.|
    |OVA_SIGN_PUBLIC_KEY| |No|[value]|Path to public key file used to sign OVA files.|
    |PLATFORM|-p|Yes|[aws \| azure \| gce \| qcow2 \| vhd \| vmware]|The target plaform for generated images.|
    |UPDATE_IMAGE_FILES| |No|[value]|Files you want injected into the image. For each of the injections, required values include source (file or directory) and destination (absolute full path).|
    |VERSION|-v|No| |Print version information, and then exit the program.|

3. When specifying a cloud provider, supply the following provider-specific information:

   * [AWS][6]
   * [Azure][7]
   * [GCE ][8]  
   
   The following platforms do not currently require platform-specific configuration:
   
   * QCOW2 (KVM Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS; OpenStack)
   * VHD (Microsoft Hyper-V)
   * VMware (ESX/i Server)

4. OPTIONAL: The Image Generator tool can inject files into the virtual disk image to allow for image customization. You can do this using the command line; however, the syntax is simpler using the configuration file:

   ```
   UPDATE_IMAGE_FILES:
    -  source: "/var/tmp/authorized-keys"
       destination: "/home/admin/.ssh/authorized-keys"
    -  source: "/var/tmp/trusted-ca.pem"
       destination: "/config/ssl/ssl.crt/trusted-ca.pem"
    -  source: "/var/tmp/custom-file"
       destination: "/config/custom-file"
    -  source: "/var/tmp/f5-declarative-onboarding-1.3.0-4.noarch.rpm"
       destination: "/config/cloud/aws/f5-declaritive-onboarding.rpm"
    -  source: "/var/tmp/f5-appsvcs-3.4.0-2.noarch.rpm"
       destination: "/var/config/rest/downloads/f5-appsvcs.noarch.rpm"
   ```    
    The Image Generator tool generates a virtual disk image from the BIG-IP product ISO. Default behavior creates this image in the **images** directory. 

    If you specify a cloud provider, then the tool uploads the generated virtual disk image to the cloud provider, and creates a virtual machine image. Depending on your environment, creating a virtual disk takes 10-15 minutes when you enable virtualization; however, if **disabled**, then disk creation takes **1-2 hours**. For this reason, it is strongly recommended that you run the Image Generator tool in environments where **virtualization is enabled**.

5. OPTIONAL: The Image Generator will attempt to use previously created local artifacts, if they exist. Therefore, if you receive an error during file upload to a cloud provider, only the cloud portion of image generation is run for a subsequent image generation. If you want to run the entire process again, use the `--clean` option to remove logs and artifacts associated with the source image, platform, modules, and boot locations.

   **Example:**
   
   1. Build an image, type: `./build-image -i /var/tmp/BIGIP-15.0.0-0.0.39.iso -c config.yml -p qcow2 -m ltm -b 1--image-tag "Name: my-custom-vm-v12.1.1" --image-tag "org: shared-services`
   2. Clean the environment associated with the specified source image, platform, modules, and boot locations, type: `./build-image --clean -i /var/tmp/BIGIP-15.0.0-0.0.39.iso -c config.yml -p qcow2 -m ltm -b 1--image-tag "Name: my-custom-vm-v12.1.1" --image-tag "org: shared-services`.

6.	OPTIONAL: You can assign image tags to published images; however, rules for image tag definitions change depending upon the target, cloud provider ([AWS][21], [Azure][19], and [GCE ][20]). 
    Currently, the Image Generator tool does not validate for each cloud providers image tag:key and image tag:value pairing. Therefore, if you do NOT 
    properly define your image tag:key/value pair for the target cloud platform, then your image is created, but your image will not have the tags that 
    you defined. To define image tags, consult one of the following examples:
    
    Configuration file (recommended):

    ```
      IMAGE_TAGS:
      - name: "my-custom-ami-v15.0.0"
      - org: "shared-services"
      - project: "alpha"
    ```
    
    Command line:

    ```
     --image-tags ‘{"name":"my-custom-ami-v15.0.0"},{"org":"shared-services"},{"project":"alpha"}’
    ``` 



##### Monitor progress

1. The Image Generator will provide high-level progress information on the console. For more details, see the log file associated with the job, located in the logs directory. Log files use the following naming convention: 
`image-PLATFORM-MODULES-BOOT_LOCATIONS` (for example, image-gce-ltm-1slot). 
2. To adjust the log level output to the log file, use the `--log-level` parameter.
   
##### Locate files

You can locate files in the following directories:
   
* **artifacts** - Artifacts created during image generation. Directory structure is based on source image, platform, modules, and boot locations.
* **docs** - Supporting documentation
* **images** - Generated images. The IMAGE_DIR parameter can be used to override this default value.
* **logs** - Log files. The LOG_FILE parameter can be used to override this default value. Default log file name is based on platform, modules, and boot locations.
* **src** - build-image script and other source files.

## Troubleshooting guide

This section provides troubleshooting information for setting up the environment and running the Image Generator tool, as well as common issues with supported cloud providers.

**Setup error message**:

The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
available. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv
package using the following command.

`apt-get install python3-venv`

**Remedy**:
You see this error, when you have not run the Setup Script. Run the [setup script][2].

**Environment error message**:
`qemu-system-x86_64: cannot set up guest memory 'pc.ram': Cannot allocate memory`

**Remedy**:
You see this error when you run in an environment with minimal memory. Increase memory for the environment.

**Environment error message**:
```
  Watchdog timer expired! (7201 seconds).
       Killing 'qemu' with pid 6073!

  Further explanation:
  The 'qemu' process should complete within a reasonable amount of time.
  If it does not, then we kill it to prevent it from blocking the build
  process indefinitely.   It is likely this is an intermittent issue and
  the next build will complete successfully.
```

**Remedy**:
Likely caused by either running in an environment that does not support virtualization or running in a lightweight environment. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

**Missing packages error message**:
```
  Traceback (most recent call last):
   File "/home/ubuntu/ve-image-generator/src/lib/bash/../../bin/read_injected_files.py", line 22, in <module>
     from util.injected_files import read_injected_files
   File "/home/ubuntu/ve-image-generator/src/lib/python/util/injected_files.py", line 24, in <module>
     import distro
```

**Remedy**:
It is possible that the setup script encountered an error and did not complete, or was run as a different user. Run the setup script again, and then review the output.

**KVM permissions error message**:
```
  Could not access KVM kernel module: Permission denied
  qemu-system-x86_64: failed to initialize KVM: Permission denied
```

**Remedy**:

* Restart your system or log out and back in to your system.
* Check that the user is in the kvm group in /etc/group (for example, kvm:x:115:ubuntu shows user ubuntu in the kvm group) .
* Check that the permissions is correct in /lib/udev/rules.d/60-qemu-system-common.rules file (KERNEL=="kvm", GROUP="kvm", MODE="0666").
* Check that /var/run/reboot-required is NOT present. You may have run the setup script, and ignored the reboot message.

**Runtime error message**:

* Review the log file. When you encounter an error, the log file can contain more detailed information regarding the error. 
* Change the log level. For troubleshooting, consider changing the log level to DEBUG or TRACE.

**AWS error message**:
`The service role <vmimport> does not exist or does not have sufficient permissions for the service to continue.`

**Remedy**:
AWS requires an **IAM Role** with import permissions (see the [AWS User Guide][3] for more information).
