## Introduction

The F5 Virtual Edition (VE) team developed the F5 BIG-IP Image Generator internally to do the following:

* Create custom images from the .ISO file for F5 BIG-IP VE releases or for hot-fixes that are not available on the various public cloud marketplaces.
* Provide pre-deployment file customization of BIG-IP (for example, SSH keys, trusted certificates, custom packages, and so forth).
* Automatically publish images to public cloud providers.
* Simplify deployment workflows, such as encrypting custom images in AWS (prevents launching an instance in the marketplace first).

##### SECURITY WARNING
----------------------
It is your responsibility to:

1.	Secure and restrict access to the environment on which you run the VE Image Generator tool, and in your cloud environment. 
2.	Remove any sensitive data on the created image PRIOR to automatically publishing the image to the cloud.

------------------------------

## Prerequisites
This section provides prerequisites for running the F5 Image Generator, creating virtual images, and for supported cloud providers.

#### Image Generator prerequisites
The following table lists system requirements for using the Image Generator to create  virtualized images of the following supported BIG-IP ISO packages:

| Component                 | Version                                                         | Recommended System Requirements|

* **VHD** (Microsoft Hyper-V) - See [VE Setup for Hyper-V][17] for more information.
* **VMware** (ESX/i Server) - See [VE Setup for vSphere][14] for more information. For advanced setup, see [creating ISO using TMOS-cloud-init][15] and [configuring user data][16]. 


##### Virtualization requirements
The Image Generator tool generates a virtual disk image from the BIG-IP product ISO. During the creation, you can specify a cloud provider. Doing so generates a virtual disk image, automatically uploads that disk to that cloud provider, and creates a virtual machine image. Options include:

* **Enabling virtualization** creates a virtual disk in **10-15 minutes** (RECOMMENDED). 
* Disabling virtualization creates a virtual disk in 1-2 hours. 

##### Tip
----------
F5 recommends running the Image Generator Tool in environments where virtualization is enabled (for example, **AWS i3.metal** instance or [GCE's KVM licensing flag for instances][25]). 

Execution times differ between cloud providers, usually taking 5-20 minutes depending on the image size. The BIG-IP Image Generator will display a **warning**, if you run the script in an **insufficient** environment **without virtualization** support.

For more information about virtualization support, see [KVM Virtualization][4].

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Environment recommendations
Due to several required tools/SDKs to generate images, F5 Networks recommends using a standalone machine/environment for the BIG-IP Image Generator. F5 provides a [setup script][2] to assist in setting up that environment. The script installs Python packages in a virtual environment to isolate them from the rest of the system; however, the script also installs other tools, such as zip, directly into the base environment. These packages are not downloaded from F5 repositories, but come from the respective project repositories. It is your responsibility to verify that these packages are safe to use. 


## Setup guide

This section provides steps for installing the generator tool, and then using the setup script. The setup script installs tools/SDKs required to generate images for all supported platforms, and takes several minutes to complete. During this setup process, certain services will require a restart.

1. Do one of the following to install the BIG-IP Image Generator source code.

   * Clone
     
     `$ git init` <br/>
     `$ git clone https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-bigip-image-generator.git` <br/>
     `or` <br/>
     `$ git clone git@github.com:f5devcentral/f5-bigip-image-generator.git` <br/>
     `$ cd f5-bigip-image-generator` <br/>
     `$ git checkout v1.0` (checkout the tag associated with the release version you want to install)
     
   * Download
   
     1. Point your browser to https://github.com/f5devcentral/f5-bigip-image-generator, open the branch with the tag associated with the release you want to install, click **Download**, and then select the file type (zip, tar.gz, tar.bz2, or tar) you want to install.
     2. At your command line, type the following (this example is uses tar.gz file type):
    
        `$ scp -i ~/.ssh/my_key Downloads/f5-bigip-image-generator-1.0.tar.gz ubuntu@image-generator-ip:/home/ubuntu/` <br/>
        `$ ssh -i ~/.ssh/my_key ubuntu@image-generator-ip` <br/>
        `ubuntu@image-generator-ip:~$ tar -xzvf f5-bigip-image-generator-1.0.tar.gz` <br/>
        `ubuntu@image-generator-ip:~$ cd f5-bigip-image-generator-1.0`  

2. To run the [setup script][2], type:  

   `./setup-build-env`
   
   Options include:
   
   * `--add-dev-tools` - installs additional tools for development, such as pylint, shellcheck, and bats

3. Restart your computer, or log out, and then log back into your system.
4. To view the Image Generator operating environment use ``./build-image --info``. This will collect information such as, installed software on the build machine. 




### Docker container setup

To avoid installing programs to your environment and enable running simultaneous image-builds on the same computer, you can utilize the [F5 container on Docker Hub][34] that provides a convenient pre-built runtime with many of the toolâ€™s package dependencies pre-installed (with the exception of VMwareâ€™s ovftool). For complete information, consult [Docker Hub][34].

## User guide

This section provides steps for creating a [config.yml][5] file that defines frequently used settings and shared variables that the BIG-IP Image Generator will use for creating custom images, running the Image Generator tool, and then customizing log details for monitoring progress. 

##### TIP

---------------------------------------------------

Before creating your configuration file for generating your image, consult the [K14946][33] article about image disk sizes for BIG-IP VE versions and template types. For example:

* LTM_1SLOT for BIG-IP VE 15.X deployed image disk size is 10 GB
* LTM for BIG-IP VE 14.X disk deployed image disk size is 37 GB
* ALL_1SLOT for BIG-IP VE 13.X deployed image disk size is 60 GB 

To define the LTM and ALL templates, use the MODULES parameter in the following table, and to define the 1SLOT or 2SLOT use the BOOT_LOCATIONS parameter in the following table. 

----------------------------------------------------


#### Create config file

1. Create a [config.yml][5] for frequently used settings and shared variables. The BIG-IP Image Generator will only use the variable definitions applicable to the specified provider and ignores other variables.

2. Define the following shared parameters or set as an environment variable. Optionally, use these parameters on the command line with leading dashes (for example, `--platform`). In some cases, you can use a shorthand flag. If a parameter is defined in multiple places, then the priority in descending order is:
command line >  configuration file >  environment variable. To access the Image Generator help file, run `-h/--help`.

    |Parameter|Flag|Required|Values|Description|
    |:--------|:---|:-------|:-----|:----------|
    | ADD_OVA_EULA |          |  No    |       |Full path or URL to a text-based EULA that you want added to VMware OVA images. |

    |ISO_SIG_VERIFICATION_PUBLIC_KEY| |No|[value]|Path to public key file used to verify an ISO.|
    |LOG_FILE| |No|[value]|Log filename that overrides the default log filename created in the logs directory. You can use a full path, directory, or filename. If full path, then the log file uses the full path. If directory, then the image generator creates a new log file in the specified directory. If filename, then the tool creates a log file in the logs directory using the specified filename.|

    |VERSION|-v|No| |Print version information, and then exit the program.|

3. When specifying a cloud provider, supply the following provider-specific information:

   * [Alibaba][26]
   * [AWS][6]
   * [Azure][7] - When creating BIG-IP images in Azure, you must also [create an application][31]. Consult the [Azure ReadMe][7] file for more information.
   * [GCE ][8]  
    
   The following platforms do not currently require platform-specific configuration:
   
   * QCOW2 (KVM Red Hat Enterprise Linux/CentOS; OpenStack)
   * VHD (Microsoft Hyper-V)
   * VMware (ESX/i Server)

4. OPTIONAL: The Image Generator tool can inject additional files (for example, keys, certs, and custom lx packages) and optionally designate file permissions into the virtual disk image to allow for image customization. You can do this using the command line; however, the syntax is simpler using the configuration file:

   ```
      UPDATE_IMAGE_FILES:   
      -  source: "/home/ubuntu/custom/authorized_keys"
         destination: "/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys"
         mode: "600"
      -  source: "/home/ubuntu/custom/trusted-ca.pem"
         destination: "/config/ssl/ssl.crt/trusted-ca.pem"
      -  source: "https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-declarative-onboarding/releases/download/v1.8.0/f5-declarative-onboarding-1.8.0-2.noarch.rpm"
         destination: "/config/f5-declarative-onboarding-1.8.0-2.noarch.rpm"
      -  source: "https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/releases/download/v3.15.0/f5-appsvcs-3.15.0-6.noarch.rpm"
         destination: "/config/f5-appsvcs-3.15.0-6.noarch.rpm"
      -  source: "https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-telemetry-streaming/releases/download/v1.7.0/f5-telemetry-1.7.0-1.noarch.rpm"
         destination: "/config/f5-telemetry-1.7.0-1.noarch.rpm"   
   ```
       

   ##### IMPORTANT
   -----------------------
   Avoid overwriting existing system related files unless directed by F5 networks. Place these additional files in typical locations where you store customizations. For example, place files in the `/config` directory where they can be included in the user configuration set (UCS) file or in the `/shared` directory, so each slot can access the customizations. Otherwise, you will lose these changes during an upgrade. For more information about UCS, see the  *file inclusion into UCS archives* topic on [AskF5][24].  

   --------------------------------

5. OPTIONAL: The default behavior of the Image Generator does NOT attempt to use previously created local artifacts, and with each subsequent generation, all files are cleaned/removed. To override the default behavior and enable reuse of local files, use the `--reuse` option. If you receive an error during file-upload to a cloud provider while using the `--reuse` option, then only the cloud portion of image generation will rerun for a subsequent image generation. Be aware that if you have already generated the virtual disk during previous runs, then using any disk-altering parameters will not be picked up on subsequent uses of the `-â€“reuse` variable.

   **Example:**
   
   To benefit from the `--reuse` parameter, you must run the Image Generator at least twice using the `--reuse` parameter for the same [PLATFORM, MODULES, BOOT_LOCATIONS] combination. In the first run, `--reuse` parameter will guarantee that the intermediary files are preserved. In the second run (when necessary), the `--reuse` parameter enables consumption of the intermediary files.
   
   1. Build an image, type: `./build-image --reuse -i /var/tmp/BIGIP-15.0.0-0.0.39.iso -c config.yml -p qcow2 -m ltm -b 1 --image-tag "Name: my-custom-vm-v12.1.1" --image-tag "org: shared-services"`
   2. To reuse the environment associated with the specified source image, platform, modules, and boot locations, type the exact same command used in Step 1: `./build-image --reuse -i /var/tmp/BIGIP-15.0.0-0.0.39.iso -c config.yml -p qcow2 -m ltm -b 1 --image-tag "Name: my-custom-vm-v12.1.1" --image-tag "org: shared-services"`.

   For debugging purposes, this tool captures the contents of the PLATFORM, MODULES, BOOT_LOCATIONS artifacts directory in a `.snapshot.zip` file (excluding large binary files). Find this `.snapshot.zip` file in the same directory as the log file (for example, `logs/image-qcow2-ltm-1slot` for log file and `logs/image-qcow2-ltm-1slot.snapshot.zip` for the artifact files). 

6.	OPTIONAL: You can assign image tags to published images; however, rules for image tag definitions change depending upon the target, cloud provider ([Alibaba][26], [AWS][21], [Azure][19], and [GCE ][20]). 
    Currently, the Image Generator tool does not validate for each cloud provider's image tag:key and image tag:value pairing. Therefore, if you do NOT 
    properly define your image tag:key/value pair for the target cloud platform, then your image is created, but your image will not have the tags that 
    you defined. To define image tags, consult one of the following examples:
    
    Configuration file (recommended):

    ```
      IMAGE_TAGS:
      - name: "my-custom-ami-v15.0.0"
      - org: "shared-services"
      - project: "alpha"
    ```
    
    Command line:

    ```
     â€“-image-tags â€˜{"name":"my-custom-ami-v15.0.0"},{"org":"shared-services"},{"project":"alpha"}â€™
    ``` 
7. OPTIONAL: If you experience disk size limitations, then increase logical volume sizes for your configurations by using the UPDATE_LV_SIZES variable for the following logical volumes (ONLY):

   * appdata 
   * config
   * log
   * shared
   * var

   For example, if you use multiple extensions on an instance that defaults to 500Mb, then you may want to increase the ``var`` LV size to 1.5GiB. Type:

   Configuration file (recommended):

   ```
   UPDATE_LV_SIZES: >-
     {
       "var": 1500
     }
   ```
   
   Command line:
   
   ```
   â€“-update-lv-sizes '{"var":1500}'
   ```
   
   ##### IMPORTANT
   -----------------------
   You can increase the size of these five logical volumes ONLY and only at the first boot location. Also, be aware that increasing these logical volume sizes will increase the overall disk size.  
   
   -----------------------


   For example, if running multiple modules, then in your configuration file add the following to update all LVs:
   
   Configuration file (recommended):

   ```
   UPDATE_LV_SIZES: >-
     {
       "appdata": 32000,
       "config": 3500,
       "log": 4500,
       "shared": 22000,
       "var": 5500
     }
   ```
   
   Command line:
   
   ```
   -â€“update-lv-sizes '{"appdata":32000,"config":3500,"log":4500,"shared":22000,"var":5500}'
   
   ```
         
   Note that these size values are examples only. To calculate the increased LV sizes for your needs, first find your base, reference LV size. 
   
   a.	From either F5 Downloads or a public cloud Marketplace, launch the base BIG-IP VE image file for your environment.

   b.	Type:

   ```
   lvs --units m
   ```
      
      
### Monitor progress

1. The Image Generator will provide high-level progress information on the console. For more details, see the log file associated with the job, located in the logs directory. Log files use the following naming convention: 
`image-PLATFORM-MODULES-BOOT_LOCATIONS` (for example, image-gce-ltm-1slot). 
2. To adjust the log level output to the log file, use the `--log-level` parameter.
   
### Locate files

You can locate files in the following directories:
   
* **artifacts** - Artifacts created during image generation. Directory structure is based on source image, platform, modules, and boot locations.
* **docs** - Supporting documentation
* **images** - The Image Generator tool generates a virtual disk image from the BIG-IP product ISO in the default, `images` directory. Use the `IMAGE_DIR` parameter to override this default value and store images in a different directory.
* **logs** - Log files. The `LOG_FILE` parameter can be used to override this default value. Default log file name is based on platform, modules, and boot locations.
* **src** - build-image script and other source files.

## Troubleshooting guide

This section provides troubleshooting information for setting up the environment and running the Image Generator tool, as well as common issues with supported cloud providers.

**Low disk space**:


```
At least 20000 MB storage is needed.  Only <space remaining> MB found.
```

**Remedy**:

```
Free up local disk space, so you have more than 20GB (20000 MB) free.

```

**Docker error message**:
```
Temporary location for injected files: '/workdir/artifacts/BIGIP-15.1.0-0.0.31/aws/ltm_1slot/tmp.CgrVUToDbf/stage.initrd/etc/injected_files'
Collecting information about installed software on the build machine
copy 'authorized_keys' to a temporary location for '/home/admin/.ssh/authorized_keys'
Invalid URL 'authorized_keys': No schema supplied.
```

**Remedy**:

You see this message when your asset files reside in a local directory, or a relative directory from where you are running the Docker command. Relocate your asset files to a Docker file directory or mount a different volume and include those files in the volume BEFORE building your image.

**Setup error message**:

The virtual environment was not created successfully because ensurepip is not
available. On Debian/Ubuntu systems, you need to install the python3-venv
package using the following command.

`apt-get install python3-venv`

**Remedy**:
You see this error, when you have not run the Setup Script. Run the [setup script][2].

**Environment error message**:
`qemu-system-x86_64: cannot set up guest memory 'pc.ram': Cannot allocate memory`

**Remedy**:
You see this error when you run in an environment with minimal memory. Increase memory for the environment.

**Environment error message**:
```
  Watchdog timer expired! (7201 seconds).
       Killing 'qemu' with pid 6073!

  Further explanation:
  The 'qemu' process should complete within a reasonable amount of time.
  If it does not, then we kill it to prevent it from blocking the build
  process indefinitely.   It is likely this is an intermittent issue and
  the next build will complete successfully.
```

**Remedy**:
Likely caused by either running in an environment that does not support virtualization or running in a lightweight environment. See [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

**Missing packages error message**:
```

     import distro
```

**Remedy**:
It is possible that the setup script encountered an error and did not complete, or was run as a different user. Run the setup script again, and then review the output.

**KVM permissions error message**:
```
  Could not access KVM kernel module: Permission denied
  qemu-system-x86_64: failed to initialize KVM: Permission denied
```

**Remedy**:

* Restart your system or log out and back in to your system.
* Check that the user is in the kvm group in: <br/>

  `/etc/group` <br/>
  `kvm:x:115:ubuntu` <br/>
  
  Shows user ubuntu in the kvm group.

* Check that the permissions is correct in the following file: <br/>

   `/lib/udev/rules.d/60-qemu-system-common.rules` <br/>
   (`KERNEL=="kvm", GROUP="kvm", MODE="0666"`)

* Check that the following is NOT present:<br/>

  `/var/run/reboot-required` <br/>
  
  You may have run the setup script, and ignored the reboot message.

**Runtime error message**:

* Review the log file. When you encounter an error, the log file can contain more detailed information regarding the error. 
* Change the log level. For troubleshooting, consider changing the log level to DEBUG or TRACE.

**AWS error message**:
`The service role <vmimport> does not exist or does not have sufficient permissions for the service to continue.`

**Remedy**:
AWS requires an **IAM Role** with import permissions (see the [AWS User Guide][3] for more information).

**VMware and AWS error message**:
`ovftool isn't installed or missing from PATH. Please install it before trying again.`

**Remedy**:
Download and install the [ovftool][22] before trying again.
